# Joint limits

This repository contains the code for adding joint limits to the human body model.

The implementation consist of two AnyScript class templates. A low level class template in `KinLimitsDriver_template.any` which adds limits to any kinematic measures, and high level class template in `JointsLimts_template.any` which helps adding joint limits joints of the musculoskeletal model in the AnyBody Managed Model Repository.


More documentation is coming.
